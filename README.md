# draw-shapes

This is a homework assignment/project I completed for the Fall 2025 session of CS 341, Programming Language Design and Implementation, at UIC, taught by Professor Shanon Reckinger.

This project was implemented in Go, and was assigned to explore the different functionalities of the modern language Go, which allows for a pretty intensive project to be completed simply.

User input is collected to design a given shape on a user-defined screen size. The user can choose between drawing rectangles, circles, and triangles onto the screen, and may choose between ten different colors. Some error checking is handled, but more needs to be put in place.

In the end, the user can choose to exit the program, which saves the image they've defined into a PPM file. This allows for easy pixel viewing, but requires a special image viewer.

The project is run on Go, and can be run natively by navigating to the working directory that this project is saved in, running `go mod init main` to compile, then `go run .` to execute.
